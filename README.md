# Data-Structures-Assignment1-


This repository contains the implementation of various sorting algorithms and data structures as part of a programming assignment.
The goal of this assignment is to test various sorting algorithms on an array of Student object using two different ways and to familiarize ourselves with the implementaion of different data structures.


## Sorting Algorithms To be Implemented and Tested

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort** 
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Shell Sort**
- **Count Sort**

## Data Structures

- **Linked List**
- **Circular Linked List**
- **Doubly Linked List**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
